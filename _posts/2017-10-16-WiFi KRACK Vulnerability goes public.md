title: WiFi KRACK vulnerability goes public

Early this morning, Mathy Vanhoef, a German-based researcher released his findings about a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol.  WPA2 is a widely-used encryption standard utilized in consumer and business WiFi networks.  

Vanhoef dubbed the vulnerability KRACK, short for "Key Reinstillation Attacks".  Vanhoef published his findings on a website, [https://www.krackattacks.com](https://www.krackattacks.com)

The vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt a user's WiFi traffic, thus potentially exposing data assumed to be safe from prying eyes.  Users may enjoy still enjoy a degree of protection if they are using a secure application layer protocol (like HTTPS) while on a compromised WiFi network.

Since the vulnerability is in the protocol itself, there is no effective workaround at this time.  Vendors will have to release patches for their products, which will take some time.

So, what should individuals and businesses do in the interim?  I recommend the following:
