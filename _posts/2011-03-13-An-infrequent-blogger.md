I'm a fairly busy guy - between work, side projects, soccer, and life in general I tend to stay busier than I probably should.

However, I've been thinking for quite some time that I need to restart my blogging attempts. It's not that I think I have anything especially earthshattering to share with the world, but I do think it's important to write on a regular basis.

That being said, I'll look to start updating this blog on a regular basis, with God-only-knows-what as my areas for discussion.
