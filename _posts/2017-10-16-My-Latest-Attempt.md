title: It's tough to write, when you're writing all the time!

Over the years, I've attempted (unsuccessfully) to commit to some type of regular blogging effort.

I'd do well for a bit, but then get pulled into other items and lose focus.  Also, it's not easy to find a blog platform that you truly control.

So, now that I've seen the cool stuff you can do with GitHub pages, I've decided to give this venue a try, and see if I can actually maintain the effort this round.

I can't make any promises that I'll be able to do so, or that you'll even find my writing interesting.  But then again, I suppose you get what you pay for...  :-)
