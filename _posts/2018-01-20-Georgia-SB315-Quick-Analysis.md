[SB 315](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20172018/SB/315){:target="_blank"} is a bill currently under consideration in the Georgia Legislature.

The bill's stated purpose is to "...create the new crime of unauthorized computer access..." which has not been previously defined under Georgia law.

While I applaud the attempt, I have some concerns about the overly vague language present in the bill as it is currently written.

The bill defines the phrase "unauthorized computer access" as "...accessing a computer or computer network with the knowledge that such access is without authority..."  However, what do the words "access" and "authorization" mean, exactly?  The bill is completely silent on these key provisions, leaving it wide open to interpretation.

As we have seen with prior attempts at legislating this type of behavior, a clear definition of authorized access is critical, so as to prevent misuse and misapplication of the law.  As we have seen with the CFAA at the federal level, there are too many federal prosecutors who, for whatever reason, take an overly broad approach when wielding the CFAA hammer, sometimes ending with tragic results (see  [https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa](https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa){:target="_blank"}).

For this bill to truly effective, and to ensure that it is not misused by overzealous and/or confused prosecutors and civil attorneys, Georgia legislators must take appropriate action to clarify their language, and ensure that there is no confusion as to what they mean by "unauthorized access".

I'll be watching this bill as it moves through the Georgia Legislature, and I hope that the citizens of Georgia will be watching as well.

UPDATES
<p>Friday, 2/2/18<br /><br />
Thanks to the [watchful eye](https://www.ef-georgia.org/index.php/action-alerts/8-georgia-sb-315-the-computer-intrusion-bill.html){:target="_blank"} of the EFF Georgia group, I learned that SB 315 was approved by the Senate Public Safety committee, and is headed to the floor of the Senate for a final vote.  If the bill passes there, it would then cross over to the House for their consideration.

The committee amended the bill, adding exemptions for parental oversight of their minor children's computer activity, as well as accessing a computer or network for "...a legitimate business activity".  Additionally, it appears the committee removed a provision that allowed for civil asset forfeiture of equipment used in conjunction with violating this law.  

Overall, I think I understand what the committee was trying to do, and I believe the intent was good.  I certainly wouldn't want to see parents punished for doing their job, and I also wouldn't want to see employees punished for engaging in "legitimate business activity."

Unfortunately, by trying to carve out these exceptions, the committee has also introduced more vague language which can lead to problems - how exactly is "legitimate business activity" defined?  The bill is silent on this.

Additionally, the committee did not add any language to clarify the meaning of "unauthorized computer access".  So, we are still stuck at square one with this issue.

Finally, while I'm glad that exceptions have been carved out in the two situations described above, security researchers in academia and industry have been left out.  In order for us to carry out our research without fear of arrest and prosecution, we should also be afforded the same protections as parents and business employees doing their daily work.

While the bill now seems to be moving rather quickly through the Senate, I'm still hopeful that these changes can be made.  Amendments could be offered up on the floor of the Senate prior to the final vote, or by the House of Representatives could make these changes as they consider the bill.

I'll continue to watch this bill as it moves through the legislative process.  I would like to thank the many people on Twitter who have seen my blog post and tweets on this issue, and have shared them to raise awareness of this situation, or have sent me private messages to share additional insights.  Thank you all!
